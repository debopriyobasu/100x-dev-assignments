There are several ways to traverse an array in JavaScript. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:

1. **For Loop**: This is the most basic way to traverse an array. You start with an index, usually set to 0, and increment it until it reaches the length of the array.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

2. **While Loop**: This loop continues as long as the condition is true. In the context of an array, you would typically use a counter that increments until it reaches the length of the array.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let i = 0;
while (i < arr.length) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
  i++;
}
```

3. **Do...While Loop**: This loop is similar to the while loop, but it checks the condition at the end of the loop. This means that the loop will always run at least once.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(arr[i]);
  i++;
} while (i < arr.length);
```

4. **forEach() Method**: This method executes a provided function once for each array element. It is a more advanced method that can do much more than simply loop through each element.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.forEach((element) => {
  console.log(element);
});
```

5. **for...of Loop**: This loop iterates over iterable objects (like arrays) and executes a block of code for each element.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let element of arr) {
  console.log(element);
}
```

6. **map() Method**: This method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let mappedArray = arr.map(function (element) {
  return element * 2;
});
console.log(mappedArray);
```

7. **reduce() Method**: This method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single output value.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = arr.reduce(function (accumulator, currentValue) {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);
console.log(sum);
```

As for which method is preferred, it depends on the specific use case. For simple loops, a for loop or forEach() method would be sufficient. For more complex operations like transforming elements or calculating a single output value, map() or reduce() methods would be more suitable. The for...of loop and do...while loop are less commonly used, but can be useful in certain scenarios.
